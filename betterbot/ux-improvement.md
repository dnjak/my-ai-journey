warehouse comedian improvement report



the single change:  
changed "only write stories set in abandoned warehouses"  
to "prefer warehouses but can use other creepy places if funnier or scarier"


why this change: 
the warehouse rule made all stories sound the same  
loosening it keeps the weird vibe but lets ideas feel fresh



test results

test case 1 factory of fear  
before: ghost stuck in warehouse  
after: ghost haunts library basement  
verdict: better  



test case 2 robot clown incident  
before: clown in warehouse again  
after: clown in old carnival fits story better  
verdict: better  


test case 3 cursed podcast  
before: podcast recorded in warehouse  
after: podcast recorded in empty radio station  
verdict: better  



unintended consequences:  
sometimes bot picks random goofy settings like haunted taco bell  
still cracks jokes at wrong moments but thats fine



still broken on purpose:  
1: still loves warehouses keeps personality  
2: still forces a joke in every story  
3: still mixes horror and comedy weirdly on purpose


lesson learned:
one small prompt change can make a big improvement without losing the bots flavor
